## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining Phase 3 items:
   - [ ] CSS animation utilities (optional)
   - [ ] Scroll-triggered animation components (optional)
2. **Begin Phase 4: Enhanced Navigation**
   - [ ] Sticky header with backdrop blur
   - [ ] Navigation items with glowing hover effects (as specified)
   - [ ] Mobile-responsive navigation
   - [ ] Smooth scroll implementation
   - [ ] Integrate `useScrollDirection` hook for header show/hide

## Session Summary (October 16, 2025)
**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Implemented `useScrollDirection` hook with 15 comprehensive tests
- ‚úÖ Made performance-first decision to skip `useMediaQuery` hook
- ‚úÖ Documented performance engineering decision in portfolio context
- ‚úÖ Both Phase 3 hooks merged to main via PRs #4 and #5

**Key Decisions**:
- Skipped `useMediaQuery` to avoid JavaScript-based responsive logic that would harm Core Web Vitals
- Will use Tailwind CSS responsive utilities exclusively for better performance
- Phase 3 hooks are complete; CSS animation utilities can be added later if needed

**Ready for Next Session**: Begin Phase 4 - Enhanced Navigation

**Note for Claude Code**: Always reference this file alongside SPECIFICATIONS.md to understand current progress and next priorities. All new code must include unit tests with 80%+ coverage.
