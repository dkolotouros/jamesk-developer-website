## Next Steps
1. **Set up branch protection rules** (manual GitHub web interface setup)
2. Create `useIntersectionObserver` hook with comprehensive tests
3. Create individual PR for the hook (tests must pass before merge)
4. Continue with remaining Phase 3 hooks
5. Move to Phase 4: Enhanced Navigation

**Note for Claude Code**: Always reference this file alongside SPECIFICATIONS.md to understand current progress and next priorities. All new code must include unit tests with 80%+ coverage.
