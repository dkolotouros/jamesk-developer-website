# Accessibility Expertise

## Focus Ring UX/Accessibility Balance (September 2025)

**Skill/Topic**: Web accessibility, WCAG compliance, UX considerations

**Context**: During Phase 2 development of personal website, James noticed that form elements (Input/Textarea components) were showing focus rings when clicked with mouse, which can be visually distracting for mouse users while still being necessary for keyboard navigation accessibility.

**Approach**:
- Identified this as a nuanced accessibility topic requiring research
- Asked specifically to check WCAG best practices before making changes
- Understood the balance between accessibility requirements and user experience

**Technical Details**:
- Problem: Using `focus:ring-2` in Tailwind CSS triggers focus rings for both mouse clicks AND keyboard navigation
- Solution: Implemented `focus-visible:ring-2` instead, which only shows focus rings for keyboard navigation
- Kept `focus:border-color` changes for both interaction types to maintain visual feedback
- Used Tailwind utility classes rather than custom CSS

**WCAG Compliance**:
- Meets WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible (AA) requirements
- Maintains accessibility for screen readers and keyboard users
- Improves UX for mouse users without compromising accessibility
- Uses modern `:focus-visible` pseudo-class with good browser support

**Impact**:
- Demonstrates understanding of nuanced accessibility requirements
- Shows ability to balance UX and accessibility concerns
- Indicates knowledge of modern CSS accessibility features
- Reflects thoughtful approach to implementation (research first, then code)

**Keywords**: accessibility, WCAG, focus-visible, keyboard navigation, UX, form accessibility, inclusive design

## CSS Code Review & Redundancy Detection (September 2025)

**Skill/Topic**: Code review, attention to detail, CSS debugging, accessibility refinement

**Context**: After implementing focus-visible changes, James identified redundant and conflicting CSS classes in the form components that I (Claude) had missed during development.

**Problem Identified**:
- Redundant `focus-visible:ring-*` classes in both base styles and variant styles
- Inconsistent error state styling with unnecessary focus overrides
- Conflicting focus behavior patterns that could confuse users

**Approach**:
- Systematically reviewed component styles before approving changes
- Asked for analysis and confirmation rather than immediate implementation
- Distinguished between subtle feedback (border colors) vs distracting elements (rings)
- Simplified error state logic to avoid focus conflicts

**Technical Resolution**:
- Moved `focus-visible:ring-*` classes from baseStyles to variant styles (eliminating duplication)
- Kept `focus:border-*` for all users (subtle feedback)
- Kept `focus-visible:ring-*` for keyboard users only (accessibility)
- Simplified error styles to just `border-red-500` (persistent error indicator)
- Let normal purple focus styles work even in error state

**UX Reasoning**:
- Error already communicated by red text below field
- Focus feedback should be consistent regardless of error state
- Red border persists to show error, purple focus shows interaction

**Impact**:
- Cleaner, more maintainable CSS
- Consistent user experience
- Better accessibility without redundant styling
- Demonstrates systematic code review approach

**Keywords**: code review, CSS debugging, attention to detail, redundancy elimination, systematic analysis
